# JavaFX-Tetris
A tetris style game coded from scratch in Java and CSS. In this project, I used Lambdas for the first time.

## Usage
If you only want to play the game, you just need to compile every file run the [Main](Main.java) class. The game can be played either with the arrow keys of the WASD keys. In order to pause the game, press space.
